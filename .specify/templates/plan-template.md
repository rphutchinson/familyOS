# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Privacy-First Architecture

- [ ] NO external services for data storage, analytics, or tracking
- [ ] All data operations use `requireAuthWithFamily()` for family isolation
- [ ] Server Actions validate authorization before database operations
- [ ] NO client-side data leaks (Server Components fetch data, Client Components receive props)

### Family Data Isolation

- [ ] Every database query scoped to authenticated user's family via `familyId`
- [ ] Cross-family data access prevented by design
- [ ] Server-side authorization in all Server Actions
- [ ] Protected routes in `src/app/(protected)/` route group

### Server-First Data Pattern

- [ ] All mutations through Server Actions in `src/actions/`
- [ ] All data fetching in Server Components
- [ ] Client Components marked with `"use client"` receive data as props
- [ ] MongoDB is source of truth (legacy Zustand stores being phased out)

### Type Safety & Explicit Contracts

- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [ ] All function signatures have explicit type annotations
- [ ] NO use of `any` type (use `unknown` if genuinely unknown)
- [ ] Database schemas defined in `src/types/database.ts`

### Simplicity & Convention Over Configuration

- [ ] Follows Next.js App Router conventions
- [ ] Module is route directory in `src/app/(protected)/` with NO registration required
- [ ] Uses shadcn/ui components (New York style) as-is
- [ ] NO premature abstractions - minimal complexity for current requirements

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
